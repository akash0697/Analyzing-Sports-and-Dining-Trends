# Analyzing-Sports-and-Dining-Trends
Analyzed and investigated potential correlations between local sports team performance and customer sentiment in sports-centric restaurants using VADER sentiment analysis, regression and BERT topic modelling

# From the Stadium to the Table: Analyzing Sports and Dining Trends

## Project Overview

This analysis explores the relationship between NFL team performance and the customer sentiment of restaurants (particularly sports bars) within corresponding states. The research evaluates if the emotional experience tied to sports victories or losses influences dining experiences and customer reviews.

**Team Members:** Akash Kumar, Will Montgomery, Evie Sun, Xiaohu Xu

## Research Question

**Does the performance of an NFL team correlate with the average sentiment score of sports bars and football-viewing dining establishments within the same state?**

## Why it Matters
- Helps businesses strategically time promotions according to team performance.
- Identifies emotional connections between sports outcomes and consumer sentiment.

## Methodology

### Data Collection
- NFL win/loss data across different states with one NFL team.
- Customer reviews from restaurants identified by the following criteria:
  - Presence of TVs
  - Categorized as bars, American cuisine, or beer-oriented establishments

### Data Processing and Analysis
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Utilized VADER Sentiment Analysis to quantify customer reviews.
- **Regression Analysis:** Conducted using Statsmodels to explore the relationship between sentiment scores and NFL team performance.
- **Topic Modeling:** Applied BERTopic modeling to extract dominant discussion themes in reviews.
- **Visualization Techniques:** Line plots, faceted bar plots, bar plots, correlation visualizations, and WordClouds.

## Key Findings
- Overall sentiment scores for sports restaurants are positive, mostly ranging between 0.75 to 1.0.
- Internal sentiment varies across states but does not significantly correlate with NFL team performance.
- Analysis revealed no consistent correlation between a team's win percentage and customer sentiment.

## Potential Improvements
- Refine sentiment scoring methods for increased accuracy.
- Narrow down analysis to specific sports-centric establishments for focused insights.
- Develop additional metrics reflecting regional sports preferences for deeper correlation analysis.

## Conclusion
- No significant correlation found between NFL team performance and restaurant customer sentiment.
- Customers largely separate their dining experience from sports outcomes.
- Businesses should prioritize controllable factors such as service quality and dining experience.
